 # Math is Music
 ### When Trigonometry meets Sound.
 
 If you are knowledgeable in somewhat higher level maths (or physics), chances are that ***Joseph Fourier*** is a name already well-known to you. Being responsible for, amongst other things, investigating the harmonic series, his breakthroughs in that field led to great advancements in engineering and a far greater understanding of a whole bunch of natural phenomena - from heat transfer in thermodynamics to *(you guessed it!)* music ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ¶

 In this playground, we'll explore how the **Fourier Series** allows us to better understand what sounds are made of, and how we can reconstruct complex timbres using the most simple of all periodic functions: the **sine**.
 
 Press ***Next*** to begin.
